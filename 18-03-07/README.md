# Binary call
* Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 3 pm
* CTA eZuce, no password required -> anyone interested welcome to join!
* Connection details are [here](ConnectionDetails.txt)

# Agenda
* Issues on Binary analysis 
* Recent devlopment on Binary Analysis with Gammapy
* Discussion on further devlopment

# Some thougts/proposal
   * Methodology
    
         * Assign phase to each of the events following ephemeris
         * Group the events in 10 phase bins
         * Run standard analysis on the events for each of the phase bins
         * calculate intergral flux for each bin. This is basically Phase-folded light curve
         * Model the phase-folded light curve
   * Proposal
   
         * a method/function to calculate phase and add to the eventlist
         * a method/function to group data into user-defined phase bins
         * a method/function to calculate differential flux for those given bins
         * a method/function to calculate integral-flux for those phase bins
         * methods/functions to model both differential flux and phase-folded light curve 
         * a method/function to test the periodicity
