# Gammapy Co-Working Week, November 2020

Instead of the autumn coding sprint we have another "Gammapy co-working week" from Nov 23rd to 27th 2020.
Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure
they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Vibe. 

In between communication via Slack: https://gammapy.slack.com (#dev channel)

For this co-working week we will put a string focus on documentation!
